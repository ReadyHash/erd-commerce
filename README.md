E-commerce is booming and you are tasked to design the database for a new online shop LAZAGA. LAZAGA sells everything from high-fashion to daily necessities. Whatever you can think of, LAZAGA sells it!

Here's what you need to do:

* Draw the ERD (you can use tools like https://www.draw.io/ or https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
* Create the SQL for tables and columns
* Write SQL queries to get information

Users should be able to login, view the catalog, add items to cart and checkout.

> You will likely need to change your tables as you expand and add more features.
> You will need more than 4 tables, excluding users, as a start

### Deliverables

Allow user to add items to cart

Show the user their total amount at checkout

Show the user their previous orders

Rank the items by their popularity

### Further

Shipping. After user checks out, how will data regarding shipping be handled?

### Further

How will a request for refund be handled? 

### Further

Variants of an item. For example, iPhone 11 is available in 6 colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White, Product Red and 3 specs: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max. How will you represent the variants in the ERD?
